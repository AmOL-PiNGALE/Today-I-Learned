Hyperlink in Markdown File
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I create a hyperlink in the README file in my GitHub account which would redirect to a new page containing the project explanation?

Follow the below format
[TEXT TO SHOW](actual URL to navigate)

ex: [Lets go to Quora](https://www.quora.com)


Using Raw Markdown
------------------------------------
You can also manually type the raw markdown text for a link. To embed links into a topic you can either use the markdown syntax like this:
[Go to the Support Web Site](https://support.west-wind.com)

or for local links using relative paths:
[Download Page](./product/download.html)


HTML Syntax
------------------------------------
Markdown also supports raw HTML so you can also use raw HTML text to embed links. This is useful if you require target links or need to add alignment styling.
<a href="./product/download.html" target="_top">Download Page</a>
