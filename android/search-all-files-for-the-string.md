# How to search all files for a string in Android Studio?

You can do it in two ways,
1. Goto `Menu -> Edit -> Find -> Find in Path`

Or use the shortcut,
2. `ctrl + shift + f`

    * On a Windows or Linux based machine use shortcut `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F` to search any string in whole project. It's easy to remember considering `Ctrl` + `F` is used to search in the current file. So just press the `Shift` as well.
    * On OSX use the `Command` key instead of `Ctrl`.
    * Use `Ctrl` + `F` combination for Windows and Linux to search in current file.
    * Use `Shift` + `Shift` (Double Tap Shift) combination for Windows and Linux to search Project File of Project.
    * `Command` + `Shift` + `F` on Mac to find in path
