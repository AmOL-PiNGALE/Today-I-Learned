# Shimmer Effect Placeholder

You might have noticed the shimmer effect in Facebookâ€™s mobile app while the data is loading from the network. Shimmer library was created by Facebook to display an animation when data is loading to make the UI more interesting and beautiful, instead of using the traditional ProgressBar. Facebook, later on, released an open-source library called Shimmer which we can use it to implement the Shimmer Effect Placeholder.

Shimmer for Android is implemented as a layout, which means that you can simply nest any view inside a ShimmerFrameLayout.

The following is an example of Shimmer effect in an Android application:
